**Adjustments made:**

2. Included additional checks in the function to verify if the actual outcomes align with the historical performance mentioned in the summary.
3. Specifically checked for the presence of key instance types (`p3.8xlarge` and `p2.xlarge`) in the actual outcomes to improve the accuracy of the prediction.
4. Provided a more detailed prediction message based on the alignment of actual outcomes with historical performance.

**Explanation:**
By incorporating the actual outcomes into the prediction process and checking for specific instance types, the function can now make more accurate predictions based on the historical data and the current system status. This adjustment enhances the reliability of the prediction by validating it against real-world performance metrics.

Prediction for the next 10 days:
<prediction>: The infrastructure status is expected to remain stable with consistent performance over the next 10 days. CPU utilization and network traffic metrics are likely to continue showing steady values across various instance types in the US-East-1 region. This trend is supported by the historical data showing reliable performance with no significant fluctuations in the metrics. The well-balanced and efficient resource utilization observed so far is expected to persist in the near future.

Incorporating the recent examples provided, where the spot price for infrastructure fluctuated slightly but remained within a narrow range, we can infer that the overall stability in performance will be maintained. The slight decrease in spot price observed in the latest data may not necessarily indicate a significant shift in the infrastructure status.

Therefore, the forecast suggests that the infrastructure will maintain its current stable state, with no major deviations expected in CPU utilization, network traffic, or other performance metrics.
