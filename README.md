# GPTOps: A Cooperative AI Agent Framework for Next-Generation Infrastructure Operations
GPTOps introduces a novel framework that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for comprehensive infrastructure management. 
By breaking down complex operational tasks into manageable subtasks, GPTOps employs a cooperative agent-based approach, combining the strengths of traditional machine learning models with the versatility of LLMs. 
This framework aims to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and decision-making process in infrastructure operations, spanning across diverse domains such as cloud computing, smart city management, and system failure prediction.
