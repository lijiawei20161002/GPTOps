## GPTOps: A Cooperative AI Agent Framework for Next-Generation Infrastructure Operations

### Agents in GPTOps
- Summary Agent: Analyzes and condenses large volumes of data into actionable insights.
- Prediction Agent: Forecasts future trends, workload demands, or potential system failures based on summarized data.
- Decision Agent: Makes strategic decisions based on predictions, optimizing for cost, performance, and reliability.
- Reflection Agent: Evaluates the outcomes of decisions against actual results, suggesting adjustments to improve future predictions and decisions.

### Ablation Baselines
- LSTM: A vanilla Long Short-Term Memory model with a single LSTM layer followed by a Dense layer.
- Reinforcement Learning: A Q-learning agent.

### Evaluation Tasks
- Dynamic VM Pricing: Focuses on real-time decision-making for VM procurement based on dynamic pricing, ensuring cost-effective cloud resource management.
- Infrastructure Failure Operation: Continuously analyze system status, predict system failures and proactively suggest maintenance or adjustments to prevent failures.
- Smart City Energy Optimization: Forecast district heating energy consumption and optimize heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system controls to minimize energy consump- tion for large building groups.
- VM Auto-Scaling: Autonomously adjust computing resources based on fluctuating demands in cloud environments.
