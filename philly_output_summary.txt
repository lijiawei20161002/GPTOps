==================================================
Group 1:
Summary: At time m29, all machines, except machine ID 80.4, had a gpu utilization of 0.0 across all GPUs (gpu0 to gpu6). Machine ID 80.4 also showed 0.0 utilization for all GPUs except gpu7, which reported 'nan' indicating missing or non-applicable data. This pattern was consistent throughout the time span.
==================================================
Group 2:
Summary: The infrastructure logs show that from time m29, Machine ID 0.0 has been consistently operating with gpu0_util to gpu6_util at 0.0 utilization. However, gpu7_util has been recording as 'nan', indicating there might be an issue with this GPU as it's not providing any utilization data. No significant events or changes in patterns have been detected within this timeframe.
==================================================
Group 3:
Summary: The logs indicate a consistent pattern where the GPU utilization for Machine ID: 0.0 remains at 0.0 for all GPUs (gpu0_util to gpu6_util) throughout the time span m29. However, the GPU utilization for gpu7_util is not available (nan) for the same machine and time span. This suggests that the machine's GPUs are not being utilized, or the data collection for gpu7_util is faulty.
==================================================
Group 4:
Summary: Throughout the given time span, all GPUs (from gpu0 to gpu6) on Machine ID: 0.0 consistently showed a utilization of 0.0, indicating no usage. However, for gpu7, the utilization data was not available (represented as 'nan'). This pattern remained consistent throughout the entire log history. There were no significant events or changes in the GPU utilization during this period.
==================================================
Group 5:
Summary: The infrastructure logs for time m29 show that Machine ID 0.0 had no GPU utilization for gpus 0 to 6. However, the data for gpu7 shows as 'nan', indicating that the values are not a number or missing. The lack of GPU utilization suggests that the machine was not performing any tasks that require GPU resources during this period. This pattern has been consistent throughout the logged period.
==================================================
Group 6:
Summary: The infrastructure logs indicate that the machine with ID 0.0 has been consistently idle at time m29, with all GPUs (0 to 6) showing a usage of 0.0. However, GPU7 utilization is not available (represented as 'nan'). This pattern is consistent throughout the time span, indicating no changes or events in machine usage.
==================================================
Group 7:
Summary: The machine with ID 0.0 has shown a consistent GPU utilization of 0.0 across all GPUs (gpu0 to gpu6) during the given time span (m29). However, the GPU7 utilization data is not available (NaN). This pattern of zero utilization suggests that the machine's GPUs were idle during this period.
